DPT-compiler-initializer
====================

This tool allows you to generate a whole new project scratch in only a couple of minutes. Including live reloading and transpiling from es6 to es5 and scss to css.

How does it work?
-----------------
```
install: npm install -g .
```

dpt-generate
-----------------
dpt-generate ensures that it is possible to generate a completely new project (the project structure) with only one command.
(It's provided with the es6 and scss folder as well)

dpt-compile
-----------------
dpt-compile generates a few files for us.

* .gitignore
* gulpfile.js
* package.json
* compiler_config.json
