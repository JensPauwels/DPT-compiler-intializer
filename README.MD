DPT-compiler-initializer
====================

This tool allows you to generate a whole new project scratch in only a couple of minutes. Including live reloading and transpiling from es6 to es5 and scss to css.

Install
-----------------
```
install: npm install -g dpt_compiler
```

How does it work?
-----------------

dpt-generate
-----------------

the command dpt-generate will active a command prompt with a few radio buttons and questions.

1) compilerpath
2) projectpath
3) which scripts you want to include
4) which css files you want to include
5) dev or build compile type -> build minifies the javascript


What does it do?
-----------------

1) generates a full project structure
2) copies some generic premade files

Is this it?
-----------------

There's one final step: (npm / yarn) install :)
